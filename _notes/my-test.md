# Home

We seem to always yearn for home. It's that part of us that we feel we cannot live without. At yet that home can be no fixed location, no physical place. If we live in one place the home is fixed and secure in memory and experience. But the same is true if we travel or relocate. If we move 5 times we will have five concepts of home. And whilst current in our lives they are the true home. It makes you wonder; where is this home? 

Our home is inside ourselves. It is conception we carry around with us. If we stay in one place for long enough we start to build the scaffolding around us. Relationship hold up the memories, meals connect the moments, and experiences wrap them all. We build this structure to try and feel that whole inside us. A hole shaped like belonging, shaped like people caring for us, shaped like love. 

Try not to feel disconnected. Try to be aware you are never away from home. The world is your experience. You are your own home. 

**You are home.**
